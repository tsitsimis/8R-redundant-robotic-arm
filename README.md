# 8R redundant robotic arm
Kinematic Control of a Redundant Manipulator

MATLAB simulation of a robotic arm with 8 rotational joints. The algorithm is based on the method of task decomposition.

-The first task of the end-effector is to follow a predefined path.

-The second task is to avoid two obstacles in the cartesian space by minimizing a cost function.
